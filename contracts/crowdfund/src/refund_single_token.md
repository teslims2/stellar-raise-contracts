# refund_single Token Transfer Logic

## Overview

`refund_single_token.rs` centralises every piece of logic needed to execute a
single pull-based contributor refund. It exposes four public items:

| Item | Kind | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `get_contribution` | fn | Read-only storage helper |
| `refund_single_transfer` | fn | Low-level token transfer primitive |
| `validate_refund_preconditions` | fn | Pure precondition guard |
| `execute_refund_single` | fn | Atomic CEI execution |

---

## Why Pull-based?

A push-based batch refund (one transaction refunds all contributors) would:
- Hit Soroban resource limits for campaigns with many contributors
- Create unpredictable and potentially unbounded gas cost
- Introduce a single point of failure for all refunds

The pull model keeps per-transaction cost O(1) — each contributor independently
claims their own refund at any time after the campaign expires.

## Dependency Map

```
lib.rs::refund_single()
  └─ validate_refund_preconditions()   [read-only, no side-effects]
  └─ execute_refund_single()
       ├─ env.storage (Effects — zero before transfer)
       ├─ refund_single_transfer()     [Interactions — token transfer]
       └─ env.events (emit refund_single event)
```

---

## CEI Pattern

`execute_refund_single` strictly follows Checks-Effects-Interactions:

1. **Checks** — done by `validate_refund_preconditions` (caller's responsibility)
2. **Effects** — contribution record zeroed, `total_raised` decremented
3. **Interactions** — token transfer via `refund_single_transfer`

Zeroing storage before the transfer is the critical re-entrancy defence. If the
token contract calls back into this contract during `transfer`, the contribution
record is already 0 and `validate_refund_preconditions` returns `NothingToRefund`.

---

## Security Assumptions

| Assumption | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Authentication | `contributor.require_auth()` must be called in `lib.rs` before `execute_refund_single`. This module does not re-check auth. |
| CEI order | Storage is zeroed before the token transfer — prevents double-claim via re-entrancy. |
| Overflow protection | `total_raised` uses `checked_sub`; underflow returns `ContractError::Overflow`. |
| Direction lock | `refund_single_transfer` always transfers contract → contributor. Direction cannot be reversed by callers. |
| Zero-amount guard | Non-positive amounts skip the token call entirely. |
| Token address from storage | `execute_refund_single` reads the token address from storage, not from a parameter, preventing callers from redirecting the transfer to an arbitrary token. |

---

## API Reference

### `get_contribution(env, contributor) -> i128`
Returns the stored contribution amount, or `0` if absent.

### `refund_single_transfer(token_client, contract_address, contributor, amount)`
Transfers `amount` tokens from `contract_address` to `contributor`. Skips the
call when `amount <= 0`. Emits a `("debug", "refund_transfer_attempt")` event
before the transfer for observability.

### `validate_refund_preconditions(env, contributor) -> Result<i128, ContractError>`
Read-only guard. Returns `Ok(amount)` when the campaign is `Expired` and the
contributor has a non-zero balance. Panics with
`"campaign must be in Expired state to refund"` for any other status.

### `execute_refund_single(env, contributor, amount) -> Result<(), ContractError>`
Atomic CEI execution. Zeroes storage, decrements `total_raised`, transfers
tokens, and emits `("campaign", "refund_single")`.

---

## Test Coverage

Tests are split across two files:

- `refund_single_token.test.rs` — unit tests for `validate_refund_preconditions`
  and `execute_refund_single` in isolation
- `refund_single_token_tests.rs` — integration tests via the full contract client

### Key test cases

| Test | Verifies |
|------|---------|
| `test_validate_returns_amount_on_success` | Happy path returns correct amount |
| `test_validate_before_deadline_returns_campaign_still_active` | Panics when Active |
| `test_validate_goal_reached_returns_goal_reached` | Panics when Succeeded |
| `test_validate_no_contribution_returns_nothing_to_refund` | NothingToRefund for stranger |
| `test_validate_after_refund_returns_nothing_to_refund` | NothingToRefund after claim |
| `test_execute_transfers_correct_amount` | Correct token balance after refund |
| `test_execute_zeroes_storage_before_transfer` | CEI — storage zeroed |
| `test_execute_decrements_total_raised` | total_raised accounting |
| `test_execute_double_refund_prevention` | Second call is no-op |
| `test_execute_large_amount_no_overflow` | checked_sub handles large values |
| `test_refund_single_double_claim_returns_nothing_to_refund` | Double-claim blocked |
| `test_refund_single_requires_contributor_auth` | Auth enforcement |
| `test_refund_single_ignores_platform_fee` | Fee does not affect refund amount |
| `test_refund_single_partial_claims_leave_others_intact` | Isolation between contributors |
